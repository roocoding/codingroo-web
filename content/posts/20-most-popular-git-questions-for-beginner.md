1. What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps software developers manage and track changes to their code. It allows for collaboration, keeping track of multiple versions, and efficient handling of code changes.

2. How does Git work?

Git works by keeping a local repository on a developer's computer, which contains all the files and their versions. Changes to the code are staged in the local repository before being committed and pushed to a remote repository for collaboration and backup.

3. What is a repository in Git?

A repository, or repo, is a collection of files and directories that are managed by Git. It contains all the history and versions of the code.

4. What is a commit in Git?

A commit is a record of changes made to the repository. Commits allow developers to save snapshots of their code and keep track of the progress of a project.

5. What is a branch in Git?

A branch in Git is a separate line of development within a repository. Branches allow multiple developers to work on different features or bugs simultaneously without affecting the main code.

6. How do I clone a Git repository?

To clone a Git repository, you use the command `git clone` followed by the URL of the repository. For example: `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git`

7. How do I create a branch in Git?

9. How do I push changes to a Git repository?

12. How do I resolve a Git conflict?

A Git conflict occurs when two or more branches have made changes to the same code. To resolve a conflict, you need to edit the conflicting code to choose which changes to keep, then stage and commit the changes.

13. What is Git stash?

Git stash is a feature that allows you to temporarily save changes in your local repository without committing them. This is useful when you need to switch to another branch or task but don't want to lose your current work.
